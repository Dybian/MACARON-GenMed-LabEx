# Introduction

### MACARON (Multi-bAse Codon-Associated variant Re-annotatiON)

MACARON (Multi-bAse Codon-Associated variant Re-annotatiON) is a python framework to identify and re-annotate multi-base affected codons in whole genome/exome sequence data. Starting from a standard VCF file, MACARON identifies, re-annotates and predicts the amino acid change resulting from multiple single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the same genetic codon. 

The information below includes how to install and run MACARON to filter a list of variant records (from VCF file) called by any existing SNP-based variant caller to identify SNVs with the same genetic codon and correct their corresponding amino acid change.

# Installation

### Runtime Prequisites

__1.__ MACARON is executable in __PYTHON v2.7 or later__. If the user has multiple PYTHON versions, please make sure that your running environment is set to the required version of PYTHON.

__2.__ Check your __JAVA__ version as MACARON is tested with: java -version
         openjdk version __"1.8.0_151"__
         OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-8u151-b12-0ubuntu0.16.04.2-b12)
         OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)

__3.__ __Genome-Analysis Toolkit__ (tested with __version 3.7-0-gcfedb67__; https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/). However, MACARON compatible with GATK≥4.0 is also available.

__4.__ __SnpEff__ (tested with __v4.3__ (build 2017-05-05 18:41). However, MACARON can also run with any older or newer version (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/download.html).

5. __SAMTools__ (tested with version __0.1.19__), however any version can be used.

### Operating System Guidelines

MACARON is know to run and build on LINUX UBUNTU 16.04 LTS. However, MACARON can be run on any other LINUX version.

Before running MACARON, please make sure that following software are properly installed:



## Contents of the folder MACARON_GenMed

* *MACARON_v0.3.py*  –  The MACARON python code
* *MACARON_validate.sh*  –  a BASH-shell script to validate multi-SNVs located on the same read that affect the same genetic codon
* *input_test.vcf* –  a test VCF file to check the functionality of MACARON
* *MACARON_output.txt*  –  The output file generated by running the MACARON.
* *sub1.chr22_21349676-21349677.sample02.bam*  –  a subset of BAM file used as input for MACARON_validate.sh
* *MACARON_validate.txt*  –  The output file with read count information of concerned pcSNV in sample02 (in this case).






For 2, 3, as long as they are compatible with JAVA, MACARON has no issues.

Additional files that will be needed are:

6. __Human Reference Genome__: Depends on user’s input.

7. __SnpEff’s Human Annotation Database__: Depends on user’s input.


A Note on TECHNICAL ISSUES:

- Chromosome (chr) notation should be compatible with both input VCF file and Human Reference Genome file, or vice versa.

- Sequence dictionaries of input VCF file and Human Reference Genome file should be the same.

- Input VCF file (should) suitably be annotated with ANNOVAR, and additionally with any other annotation software, e.g, VEP (https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) if the user has a desire to get the full functionality of -f option (see below).

- Same Human Reference Genome file should be used for MACARON which is practiced earlier to call variant sets.

- Version of both Human Reference Genome file and SnpEff database file should be the same (hg19 / GRCh37 = SnpEff GRCh37.75) or (hg38 / GRCh38 = SnpEff GRCh38.86).

## RUNNING THE PIPELINE

Before running MACARON, please add full paths of GATK and SnpEff to MACARON algorithm, e.g.,

```bash
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:￫￫	Full path to the software directories should be set before compiling.
"""
GATK="/full_path_to/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar"
HG_REF="/full_path_to/Human_Reference_Genome.fasta"
SNPEFF="/full_path_to/snpEff.jar"
SNPEFF_HG="GRChXX.XX"
```

Output file name prefix: MACARON uses input VCF file name as prefix by default. User can change it with `-o` option.

```bash
python MACARON_v0.3.py -i input_test.vcf -o MACARON_output.txt -d full_path_of_input_VCFfile_directory -f INFO_FILED_HEADER`
```

## ADDITIONAL OPTIONS:

-f has three options:

* -f CSQ (if input VCF file is additionally annotated with VEP, the output txt file also has the same complete annotation for each variant record)

* -f EFF (if user wants to output SnpEff annotations in output txt file), or -f ANN (if SnpEff is used without -formatEff option)

* -f DP,AF,Func.refGene,Gene.refGene,GeneDetail.refGene (this will keep any other default annotations of input VCF file and of ANNOVAR to output txt file)

-f can be used multiple times, e.g.,

* -f CSQ,DP,Func.refGene
or
* -f EFF,CSQ,AF

The order of the columns in the output txt file depends on the order of INFO headers used here.


## VALIDATING SNVs' PRESENCE ON THE SAME READ

To confirm the existence of multi-SNVs within the same genetic codon, an accessory BASH-shell script (available with MACARON) calculates the read count information of affected bases. Using SAMTools, generate a subset of your BAM file (it should be the same used to generate VCF file for MACARON run) covering 50 bps over each clustered SNVs.

example: 

```bash
samtools view –hb –L sub1.bed sample02.bam > sub1.chr22_21349676-21349677.sample02.bam`
```

```bash
sub1.bed
chr22	21349676
```

The naming format of output BAM file should be the same.

Once subset BAM files are generated, run MACARON_validate.sh.

example: `MACARON_validate.sh sub1.chr22_21349676-21349677.sample02.bam`

This will generate an output text file (`MACARON_validate.txt`) allowing the user for further analysis.
